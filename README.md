Sage code and data for 

"Quadratic Chabauty and rational points II: Generalised height functions onSelmer varieties" (Jennifer S. Balakrishnan and Netan Dogra)

For code to carry out Example 1 (Section 7.5.1), the main file is Ex1.sage. 
For code to carry out Example 2 (Section 7.5.2), the main file is Ex2.sage.

To run either example, replace the following Sage library files with the files in this repository and rebuild Sage:
 * src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_generic.py
 * src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/hyperelliptic_padic_field.py
 * src/sage/schemes/hyperelliptic_curves/monsky_washnitzer.py
